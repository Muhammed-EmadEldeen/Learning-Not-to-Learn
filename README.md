While I succesfully captured the main points of the papers and done them correctly,I wasn't able to reach their accuracy.

1. I began first by creating the datasets
  - Train dataset: every digit has mean color
  - Test dataset: each sample color is chosen randomly
2. I created the model as specified in paper
3. Finally I created the loss functions and started training, in the process I was tuning the hyperparameters.
