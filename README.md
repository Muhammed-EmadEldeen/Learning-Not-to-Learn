## Problem Definition
This project implements the "Learning Not to Learn" paper, focusing on mitigating bias in the colored MNIST dataset. The goal is to train a model that unlearns color-based biases present in the training data, improving accuracy on an unbiased test dataset. The baseline model achieves 68% accuracy, while the proposed method increases it to 90%.

## Procedure

1. Dataset Creation  

        - Training Dataset: Each digit is assigned a mean color to introduce bias.  
        - Test Dataset: Colors are assigned randomly to ensure no bias.


2. Model Development  

        - Implemented the baseline and paper models as described in the "Learning Not to Learn" paper.


3. Training and Hyperparameter Tuning  

        - Defined custom loss functions to unlearn bias.  
        - Tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance.


4. Evaluation  

        - Evaluated model performance using accuracy and confusion matrices.  
        - Visualized results to compare baseline (68% accuracy) and paper model (90% accuracy).
